# Inception - 42 Project Devops Projects

## Introduction
Inception is a project from 42 school focused on Docker and containerization. The goal is to create a fully functional multi-container infrastructure using Docker Compose, managing services efficiently while leveraging volumes, networks, and Docker best practices.

## üì¶ Docker Concepts Overview
### üñºÔ∏è Docker Images & Containers
A Docker image is a blueprint for running an application. A container is a running instance of an image. Containers are isolated but can communicate through networks.

### üìÑ Dockerfile
Each service in this project is built from a `Dockerfile`, defining the base image, dependencies, and configurations required to run the service.
Blueprint for building images containing:

    - Base image

    - Dependencies

    - Configuration files

    - Startup commands

### üìÇ Volumes (Bind Mounts)
Volumes store persistent data. In this project, bind mounts are used to link directories on the host to directories inside the container, ensuring data persistence between restarts.

### üåê Docker Network (Bridge)
A bridge network allows multiple containers to communicate within an isolated network. Each container in this project is attached to a bridge network to enable communication between services.

### üéõÔ∏è Docker Compose
Docker Compose simplifies multi-container management using a `docker-compose.yml` file. This file defines all services, networks, and volumes needed for the project.

## üöÄ Services Overview (this is just the conclusion of every service search more to understand all the concept)
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests.
- **MariaDB**: Database management system for WordPress.
- **WordPress**: Web application with a CMS for content management.
- **Adminer**: Web-based database management tool.
- **FTP**: File transfer service.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store.
- **Codvisor**: Additional monitoring/debugging tool.
- **StaticWeb**: Serves static web content.

## üîÑ Docker Runtime Architecture Explanation
- **dockerd**: The main Docker daemon managing containers, networks, and images.
- **docker-containerd**: A daemon that handles container execution and lifecycle.
- **docker-runc**: A low-level runtime that directly interacts with containers.
- **docker-containerd-ctr**: A command-line tool for interacting with containerd.
- **docker-containerd-shim**: Ensures containers remain running after containerd exits.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage
  #### Prerequisites

  - Docker & Docker Compose

  - GNU Make

  - Proper directory permissions

  #### Configuration

  - Clone repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/nourddine-benyahya/inception
      ```

  - Set up secrets:
      ```bash
      cp secrets/example.*.txt secrets/same_name_with_out_eaxmple.txt
      ```
        ```bash
      cp srcs/example.env srcs/.env
      ```

  - Edit .env and secrets file with your credentials

  #### To build and start the project, run

  - This will execute Docker Compose to build and start all defined services.
      ```bash
      make
      ```
  - To stop and remove containers, run:
      ```bash
      make clean
      ```
  - To remove all images, volumes, and networks, run:
      ```bash
      make fclean
    ```

Access Services

  - WordPress: https://localhost

  - codvisor: http://localhost:8080

  - Adminer: http://localhost:9090

  - Static Site: http://localhost:4242


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a containerized multi-service infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose, implementing best practices for networking, volumes, and service management.
